## What
A Jekyll & Bootstrap static single page portfolio. Hosted on GitHub pages for free with SSL/TLS :tada:

This project builds on [volny's theme](https://github.com/volny/creative-theme-jekyll) :raised_hands:

This app uses Ruby. If you're on a Mac, I'd suggest using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for installing it.

You can update your Rails version with:
```sh
gem update --system
```

To install local dependencies to run locally:
```sh
bundle install
```

To run locally:
```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
